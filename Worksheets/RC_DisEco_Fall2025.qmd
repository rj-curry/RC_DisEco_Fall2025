# Worksheet 1: Introduction

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

# Worksheet 2: Sample Size for Disease Detection

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

[*The suggested sample size to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 at 95% C.I. is **59 individuals***]{.underline}

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

[*The sample sizes suggested when detecting a disease at 1% prevalence with a 95% C.I. are **considerably greater** than the samples sizes suggested when detecting a disease at 2% prevalence with a 99% C.I., reaching up to 70 more individuals in larger populations.*]{.underline}

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is [***\<1%***]{.underline}.
