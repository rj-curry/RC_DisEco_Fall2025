# Worksheet 1: Introduction

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

# Worksheet 2: Sample Size for Disease Detection

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

[*The suggested sample size to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 at 95% C.I. is **59 individuals***]{.underline}

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

[*The sample sizes suggested when detecting a disease at 1% prevalence with a 95% C.I. are **considerably greater** than the samples sizes suggested when detecting a disease at 2% prevalence with a 99% C.I., reaching up to 70 more individuals in larger populations.*]{.underline}

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is [***\<1%***]{.underline}.

# Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

\
a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.\
[*06/12/25 - **0.2 cases per elk day***]{.underline}

[*06/14/25 - **0.4 cases per elk day***]{.underline}

[*06/15/25 - **0.6 cases per elk day***]{.underline}

\
b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit\
for prevalence.

[*06/13/25 - **21% prevalence of conjunctivitis***]{.underline}

[*06/16/25 - **9% prevalence of conjunctivitis***]{.underline}

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

[*The prevalence is the same as the incidence on **06/10/25***]{.underline}

\
d) On which day is the incidence lowest?

[*The incidence is the lowest on**06/10/25 or day 1***]{.underline}

# Worksheet 4: Multihost pathogens, Spillover

**MERS-CoV**\
Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

    [***Incorrect - MERS-CoV has limited human-to-human transmission and is primarily maintained in Camel populations.***]{.underline}

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    [***Correct - Camels act as the main reservoir for MERS-CoV through direct physical contact leading to transmission to humans***]{.underline}

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    [***Incorrect - Human-to-human transmission is possible but limited, only occuring through prolonged close-contact, mainly in health care-associated environments.***]{.underline}

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
    65%. (2 points)

    [***Incorrect - Approximately 35% of reported MERS-CoV cases have been fatal.***]{.underline}

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    [***Incorrect - The epidemic curve indicates a propagated outbreak due to multiple peaks, or outbreaks, present on the epidemic curve.***]{.underline}![](images/MERS.png)

# Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

\
1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
infectious disease? Justify your classification.

[***This outbreak of Marburg virus would be classified as a spillover, but had a high chance of becoming an EID. Marburg virus probably began because someone visited a bat cave, which is a rare occurance for transmission. However, once in humans, Marburg virus is capable of low human-to-human transmission which was kept low and had the potential of being much worse if not for Rwanda's actions.***]{.underline}\
2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
community and healthcare settings?

[***Rwanda's response to Marburg virus showed success to be learned from for any similar cases in the future. To help reduce transmission risk in healthcare settings, Rwanda provided thorough training to healthcare workers once the virus was detected, had strict rules on PPE, and kept patients contained and quarantined. In the community, Rwanda's ability to detect the virus quickly and educate the public on how to avoid contact helped reduce transmission risk.***]{.underline}

# Worksheet 6: Using QPweb (Quantitative Parasitology)

A new disease, *Vertico*, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

[***Pond 1: 30% Prevalence 95% CI 14%-53%***]{.underline}

[***Pond 2: 7% Prevalence 95% CI 0.3%-30%***]{.underline}

[***p-value: 0.1987 - The difference is not statistically significant***]{.underline}
